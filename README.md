# Utils

A collection of all the common utility functions, classes and types I use in most of my projects.

## ToDo

-   None

## Versions

### 1.1.4

-   Fixed exports again

### 1.1.3

-   Reordered types export to avoid 'never used' warning

### 1.1.2

-   Fixed incorrect export setup in package.json

### 1.1.1

-   Fixed missing DOM types export

### 1.1.0

-   Added DOM utils and structured them into their own subpath /dom
    -   Changed export structure
    -   Compilation uses tsup now instead of tsc, to allow for DOM / Node separation

### 1.0.0

-   First version extracted and collected by looking through all my project's utils.ts files
